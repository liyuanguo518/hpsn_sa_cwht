            - 
        - TODOs: 
            - To understand Recall, Precision, and F1-score based on the fig.3 of Matlab code
            - Based on the understanding of the calculation of F1-score, re-generate the Fig.4 in (Guo, et al., 2022)
            - To understand the Matlab code in detail

#### 04.07.24:
    - Contents from Liyuan: 
    - Contents from Meng:
        - Done: 
            - understand the Matlab Code in detail
            - use three datasets to draw graph of F1-score
        - Questions: 
            - a lack of datasets 
            - not lower/upper limit but standard deviation
        - TODOs: 
            - re-generate fig.4 with more datasets
            - learn about the background and features of cwht
            - to check if there are any other parts of the code that i don't understand

#### 14.07.24:
    - Contents from Liyuan: 
    - Contents from Meng:
        - Done: 
            - use 22 datasets to draw F1-score
        - Questions: 
            - Standard Deviation more than 1
            - graph of F1-Score is different from the paper (The average value is less than 0.9)
        - TODOs: 
            - Write down the meaning of each line of code so that you can understand it later.
            - Create a new folder in GitHub and upload local files

#### 01.11.24:
    - Contents from Liyuan: 
    - Contents from Meng:
        - Done: 
            - use 22 datasets to draw F1-score
        - Questions: 
            - graph of F1-Score is different from the paper (The average value is less than 0.9)
        - TODOs: 
            - Use Do_clustering.m to recalculate the F1_Score of 22 datasets
            - Use WHT instead of PCA, loop through different eigenvalues ​​FE, and give the best feature combination and its corresponding best F1_Score

#### 20.11.24:
    - Contents from Liyuan: 
    - Contents from Meng:
        - Done: 
            - Use Do_clustering.m to recalculate the F1_Score of 22 datasets
            - Use WHT instead of PCA, loop through different eigenvalues ​​FE, and give the best feature combination and its corresponding best F1_Score
        - Questions: 
            - The F1-Score graph regenerated by Do_clustering.m is still somewhat different from the graph in the article.
        - TODOs: 
            - Use Matlab's built-in fwht function to calculate the F1-Score and compare it with the previous wht result to verify the accuracy of the previous wht.

#### 28.11.24:
    - Contents from Liyuan: 
    - Contents from Meng:
        - Done: 
            - 
        - Questions: 
            - The replacement of fwht has not been implemented yet, and an error occurs: The number of ValpredicateLabels does not match the number of ValtrueLabels.
        - TODOs: 
            - Continue to implement the replacement of fwht
            - Use Do_clustering.m to recalculate the F1_Score of 22 datasets
